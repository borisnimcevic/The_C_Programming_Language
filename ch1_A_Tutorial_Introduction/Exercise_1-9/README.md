Comment: For this exercise I used a .txt file for pracitce. Chapter does not cover the ropic of opening, reading and closing the file. The code I am using is modified code from the following link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-print-contents-file/

The text in dennis.txt are the fisrt two paragrapshs from Dennis Ritchie's wiki page.

I added random spaces in dennis_space.txt for thepurpose of this exercise.
